👋 Hi, I’m @mevelick (Marni)

👩‍💻 I am: A (relatively) recent graduate. I received my BS in Computer Information Systems and have been exploring my interests and building my skills since graduating. I have narrowed down my choices to data analytics or software development (specifically mobile/iOS development).

💼 Work: I work as a Support Operations Coordinator of Quality Assurance for a late-stage startup mobile app company

💻 Programming languages:
1. Python
2. Swift
3. C++, & Python

🏔️ Goal: I am *just* beginning to dip my toes into the world of data and am enjoying it very much. I plan to focus my attention on learning more about data analytics in the near future.
