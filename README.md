👋 Hi, I’m @mevelick (Marni)

👩‍💻 I am ... a recent graduate and remain undecided on a career path. I am interested in data analytics, software development, iOS development, or front-end web development.

💼 I work ... for a late-stage startup mobile app company as a Support Operations Coordinator of Quality. I plan to continue in this role until I have decided on my path.

🌱 I’m ~~currently~~ was in the process of learning ... Swift, C++, & Python. However, I've hit the "pause" button while trying to make up my mind. I will resume my skill-building once I know what I need to be learning.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... any projects related to data analysis, web development, and/or software development - anything that will help me get experience and help me make a decision!

📫 How to reach me ... by email at marni.velick@gmail,com
